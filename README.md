[Baby Daily - Smiles, steps and stories. Daily!](https://iurjoh-baby-daily-backend-api-1674476236b8.herokuapp.com/)



This project was incomplete due to force majeure circumstances.

Two new components were created: Tasks and Wishes

In both CRUD functionalities are working perfectly.

In Tasks it will be possible to organize and manage the necessary activities and tasks to be carried out throughout pregnancy and the first months of life.

In Wishes a list of gifts can be viewed and other users can offer to buy the items listed to help the newly arrived baby and new parents.



( --->>> still to be done <<<--- )

Tests were carried out throughout development but were not documented to be added satisfactorily at the moment (still to be completed).

The design part follows the mold of the "Moments" project model, but future updates will give a more authorial look to the project.

All Agile, user stories and other development assistance tools will be documented in a future update.

After the first evaluation of this project I will work even harder to resolve and implement the criticisms and suggestions that may be made, as well as I will work so that all other basic requirements for this PP5 Advanced Frontend can be achieved in the next update.

Thank you for your understanding and attention!
